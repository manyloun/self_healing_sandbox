# Autonomous Multi-Agent Medallion Data Pipeline Sandbox

This repository showcases a production-grade, self-healing data analytics engine designed to execute schema mapping, code generation, and automated validation routines over telemetry and transit datasets (NYC TLC Parquet streams). 

Engineered explicitly using **Claude Haiku 4.5** as a decoupled orchestration controller, the framework maps directly to enterprise data platform paradigms utilized across Databricks and Azure environments.

## 🏗 Architecture Blueprint

Instead of a monolithic single-agent loop, this project deploys a **Multi-Agent Decoupled Pipeline** to maximize token efficiency, implement active security controls, and prevent drift:

1.  **Schema Specialist Agent (`schema_specialist.py`)**: 
    *   Acts as the system's "Eyes."
    *   Uses an in-memory transport stream (`io.BytesIO`) to query and extract structural file headers and physical parquet layouts via `pyarrow` metadata blocks *without* downloading multi-gigabyte files.
    *   Outputs an isolated technical profile mapping temporal grains, foreign aggregation keys, and revenue components.
2.  **Code Generation Agent (`code_generator.py`)**:
    *   Acts as the system's "Muscle."
    *   Consumes the decoupled schema profile to construct type-safe Pandas/PySpark ingestion scripts, removing "guessing" vectors.
3.  **Safe Sandbox Environment (`sandbox.py`)**:
    *   Executes dynamic strings within a restricted execution scope.
    *   Deploys active command verification flags to block destructive Windows operations (e.g., `Invoke-Expression`, `Remove-Item`).
4.  **Orchestrator Control Loop (`orchestrator.py`)**:
    *   Manages state and cross-agent communication.
    *   Captures runtime exceptions, intercepts tracebacks, and programmatically feeds errors back to the model for self-directed compilation adjustments (Self-Healing).

## 🧱 Medallion Data Lifecycle Alignment

The architecture is designed to automate logic verification within a **Medallion Data Architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold):
*   **Bronze (Ingest Validation)**: The `SchemaSpecialist` acts as an automated ingestion check, catching schema drift in raw telematics data before compute resources are allocated.
*   **Silver (Self-Healing Transformation)**: The `Orchestrator` automates the path from raw ingestion to cleaned datasets. If a transformation fails, the system isolates the logic error and self-corrects the code in real-time.
*   **Gold (Business Logic)**: The engine produces verified, human-readable reports on core metrics like trip counts and financial averages, ready for stakeholder decision-making.

## 🛠 Claude Code Native Extension Integration

This repository is built explicitly to hook into Anthropic's **Claude Code** agentic CLI tool infrastructure using its official, native directory layout format:

### Workspace Directory Layout
```text
D:\self_healing_sandbox\
├── .claude\
│   ├── settings.json
│   ├── hooks\
│   │   └── pre-commit.py
│   └── skills\
│       └── run-pipeline\
│           └── SKILL.md
├── orchestrator.py
├── schema_specialist.py
├── code_generator.py
├── sandbox.py
├── mcp_server.py
└── CLAUDE.md
```

- **`.claude/settings.json`**: Enforces strict environment constraints, targeting native Windows 11 CMD profiles and loading localized Model Context Protocol handlers.
- **`.claude/hooks/pre-commit.py`**: A custom automation hook. It intercepts workspace updates and executes an automated compilation pass over our engine scripts to block invalid code syntax from entering production.
- **`.claude/skills/run-pipeline/SKILL.md`**: A native markdown skill specification utilizing YAML metadata headers to register the `/run-pipeline` sub-agent workflow.
- **`mcp_server.py`**: A custom **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server**. It exposes local database schema layouts over standard tool-calling communication lines, mirroring Databricks Unity Catalog metadata integrations.

### Running the Custom Workflows
When using the Claude Code tool inside this directory, invoke your custom tools using simple natural language:

```text
Run the /run-pipeline skill for green taxi month 1 to calculate trip count
```

## 🚀 Execution Profile (Development Mode)
To ensure cost governance and high-speed testing, the engine is currently optimized for the **Green Taxi Records** dataset partition. This allows for rapid iteration of the self-healing logic and schema mapping over a smaller data footprint before scaling to larger multi-terabyte datasets.

## ⚙️ Engineering Hygiene
*   **Decoupled Architecture**: Logic is modular, allowing for targeted unit testing of sub-agents.
*   **Memory Optimization**: Uses byte-streaming to profile large remote files without high local disk I/O or "Unrecognized Filesystem" errors.
*   **Cross-Platform Readiness**: Fully optimized for Windows 11 CMD environments without Unix bash dependencies.
